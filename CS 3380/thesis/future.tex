\chapter{Future Work}

Further work is needed to solve the problems that exist in current solution. Here are two directions to improve the program to make it more efficient: easier to use and faster to process the image.:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Automatically set some parameters, such as the parameters for Canny edge detection, block size, or r value threshold, etc.
\item Find out a way to make this program to be more accurate, for example, in figure1 we should make it auto-remove those lat-lag lines, then we should have a better detecting result.
\item Also consider the color for contrails always in simlar color, then we can aviod some bad situations also.
\end{enumerate}
