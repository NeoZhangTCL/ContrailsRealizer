\chapter{Future Work}

Further work is needed to solve the problems that exist in current solution. 
Here are two directions to improve the program to make it more efficient and
easier to use:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Automatically set some parameters, such as the parameters for Canny edge detection, block size, or r value threshold, etc. 
\item Use the MatLabâ€™s parallel processes computing to reduce the loop processing time. 
As well, it may be possible to use MatLab parallel processing toolbox 
(i.e. GPU processing) is the computer being used has a NVIDIA gou chip).
\end{enumerate}
