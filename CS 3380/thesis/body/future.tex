\chapter{Future Work}

Further work is needed to solve the problems that exist in current solution. Here are two directions to improve the program to make it more efficient: easier to use and faster to process the image.:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Automatically set some parameters, such as the parameters for Canny edge detection, block size, or r value threshold, etc. 
\item Use the MatLabâ€™s parallel processes computing to reduce the loop processing time.
\end{enumerate}
