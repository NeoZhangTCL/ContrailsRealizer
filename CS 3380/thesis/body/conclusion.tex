\chapter{Conclusion}

This project is designed to recognize the contrails from clouds image. Using canny edge detection, polynomial curve fitting, and Hough Transform to solve this problem. Following the algorithms below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Grayscale the original image
\item Use canny edge detection to get the edge
\item By getting the small blocks pixel by pixel, and do the polynomial curve fitting to get the small line information
\item Put pixels survive the block processes into a new image
\item Do the Hough Transform on new image
\item Plot the results
\end{enumerate}
From the results, it can be seen that the problem has been fairly solved. However, still, some problems exist, such as parameters setting, data miss deleted, and time issues.\\
We can still do some further research on solving this problem, for example, making the program more efficient or easier to use.
