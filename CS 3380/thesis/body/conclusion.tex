\chapter{Conclusion}

This project is designed to recognize the contrails from clouds image. Using 
Canny edge detection, polynomial curve fitting, and the Hough Transform (all
via MatLab) we have proposed a solution to problem. The algorithms we developed are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Convert the original image to grayscale,
\item Use the Canny edge detector to compute edge maps,
\item Processing small blocks edgel by edgel and performing polynomial curve fitting 
to obtain the best small line fit in each block and then thresholding edgels 
based on the residual of the line fit,
\item Placing edgels that survive this residual thresholding into into a new image,
\item Performing a Hough Transform on new edgel image to extract significant lines and
\item Plotting the results.
\end{enumerate}
From the results, it can be seen that the problem has been fairly well solved. 
However, some problems still exist, such as parameters setting, good data that 
was missed or deleted, and computational time issues.

We can still do some further research on solving this problem, for example, 
making the program more efficient or easier to use.
